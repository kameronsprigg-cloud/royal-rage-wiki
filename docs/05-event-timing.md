# Event Mastery: The Calendar of War

> **Principle:** "Red Dots are Stop Signs."
> In this game, patience is a currency. If you click a "Claim" button or finish an upgrade on the wrong day, you are literally burning free resources. We do not play randomly; we play on schedule.

## 1. The "Double Dip" Doctrine
Every action you take should score points in **at least two** places simultaneously. If you are only scoring in one, you are wasting the action.

**The Holy Trinity of Efficiency:**
1.  **VS Duel:** The Weekly Theme (The "What").
2.  **Arms Race:** The 4-Hour Window (The "When").
3.  **Capitol Buffs:** The Multiplier (The "How").

:::tip The Golden Rule
**NEVER** use speed-ups or resources for a VS Event unless the matching **Arms Race** is also active.
* **Bad:** Upgrading a building on Tuesday morning because you feel like it.
* **Good:** Waiting until Tuesday at 0800 Server Time when the "City Building" Arms Race starts, *then* dropping your speed-ups.

## 2. The VS Duel Weekly Schedule 
This is your Bible. Memorize it.

| Day | Theme | The "Hoard" (What to Save) | The Protocol |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monday** | **Radar & Stamina** | Stamina Items, Radar Tasks | Save Radar tasks from Sunday. Burn Stamina on Zombies. |
| **Tuesday** | **Base Building** | Building Speed-ups | **Secretary of Development** Sync with "City Building" Arms Race. |
| **Wednesday** | **Tech Research** | Research Speed-ups, Valor Badges | **Secretary of Science** is mandatory here. Sync with "Tech Research" Arms Race. |
| **Thursday** | **Hero Advancement** | EXP, Shards, Skill Medals | **STOP.** Do not upgrade heroes during the week. Unleash them today. |
| **Friday** | **Total Mobilization** | Troops | Train troops, upgrade gear, use what you need, as all speed-ups count. This is the prep for War. |
| **Saturday** | **Enemy Buster (War)** | Teleporters, Shields, Troops | **Kill Day.** Teleport to the enemy server. Burn their hives. |

## 3. The Arms Race Cycle (4-Hour Rotation)
The Arms Race rotates every 4 hours. It tells you *exactly* when to execute your VS tasks. 

Timings: Arms Race will ALWAYS line up with the main VS theme at the following times: 

:::tip Arms Race Timings
* 0800 - 1200 Server Time
* 2000 - 0000 Server Time
* SPECIAL: Drone Timing is 1600 - 2000 Server Time for VS Day 1
:::

* **City Building:** Drop your building speed-ups here.
* **Tech Research:** Drop your research speed-ups here.
* **Unit Progression:** Train troops here.
* **Drone Boost:** Consume drone parts here.
* **Hero Advancement:** Use hero EXP/shards here.

:::warning Synchronization
If it is Tuesday (Building Day) but the Arms Race is "Drone Boost"... **DO NOT BUILD.** Wait for the clock to turn.

## 4. Weekend War & Capitol Buffs
The climax of the week is the Server War (Saturday). This is where the **Capitol Buffs** transition from "Economic Tools" to "Weapons of War."

### The Wartime Protocol
During the war, the Ministrial titles change function. We are not farming; we are hunting.

1.  **Secretary of Strategy:**
    * **Peace Time:** Useless.
    * **Desert Storm** **USEFUL!** It let's you make 25% better use of your healing speed ups. This can let you stay in the fight a lot longer.
2.  **Secretary of Defense:**
    * **Peace Time:** Training speed.
    * **War Time:** **Lethality.** Use this to pump out reinforcements instantly.
3.  **The Server Buff (The Winner's Spoils):**
    * If we win the VS Duel, our server gets buffs (Gathering speed, Research speed).
    * **The Strategy:** If we are winning the war on Saturday, **HOLD** your major Sunday collections until the Server Buff activates.

#### "Red Dots are Stop Signs"

* **Radar:** Do not clear your Radar on Sunday. Save the tasks for Monday (Day 1).
* **Stamina:** Do not burn stamina on Sunday night. You need a full bar for Monday reset.
* **Hero Recruitment** Do not recruit heroes from the tavern just because there's a little green dude there.
* **Hero XP** Is it day 4 of VS? No? Don't use a large amount of XP. Max 1 or 2 levels to hit arms race boxes.
* **Construction Presents** These get annoying, but hold off on popping those presents until Construction VS day! 

:::tip **Use the Settings to your advantage!**
There's a setting in your profile that let's you enable a warning for popping a construction present. Use it!
:::
* **Hero Tier Up** That green arrow in the hero page is tempting, innit? Don't do it. Wait for Hero day.

## 5. The Financial Reality: The $1,500 Mistake
Why are we so strict about VS boxes? Let’s talk strictly value.

**The Base Game Value:**
A full 9-box VS day is worth roughly **$2,150 USD** in raw gem purchases. That is for *one single day*.

**The "Discount" Reality:**
Realistically, if you are spending money, you are buying value packs, not raw gems. Even if we apply a generous 43x discount for bundles, that is still **$50 USD of value per day** just to keep up with free-to-play players who play intelligently.

### The Cost of Laziness
If you miss your VS boxes because you didn't save your speed-ups, go ahead and take a **$50 bill** out of your wallet and throw it in the fireplace.

* **Daily Loss:** $50
* **Monthly Loss:** $1,500

**Conclusion:**
Stop being poor. Treat your inventory like a vault, not a vending machine. Collect your $50 daily salary.
