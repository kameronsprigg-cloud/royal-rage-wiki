# Infrastructure & Logistics

> **Principle:** This isn't just a war game; it's a logistics simulator. If your base is inefficient, your army is irrelevant. We build smart, not hard.

## 1. The HQ "Waterfall"
The game forces a dependency chain. You cannot upgrade your HQ without upgrading specific buildings first.

:::tip The Golden Path
Do not guess. Look at the chart below.
Always upgrade your **HQ Prerequisites** first. If the HQ requires a Wall, and the Wall requires a Tank Center, your priority is **Tank Center -> Wall -> HQ**.

    marginBottom: '20px', 
    border: '1px solid #ddd', 
    borderRadius: '8px'
  }}

## 2. The "Triple Dip" Doctrine (Barracks)
**This is the single most important economy tactic in the game.**

Most players train T8 troops directly. This is mathematically lazy and forfeits millions of points.

### The Math
* **Time Cost:** It takes the **exact same amount of time** to promote a T5 to T6 as it does to promote a T7 to T8.
* **Point Gain:** If you train a T8 directly, you get points once. If you promote T5 -> T6 -> T7 -> T8, you get points **three separate times** for the same soldier.

### The Protocol
1.  **Stagger Your Barracks:** Keep your barracks at specific intervals to handle different tiers.
    * **The Royal Spread:** Level 30 - 27 - 24 - 20 - 17 - 14.
2.  **Train Low (Mon-Thurs):** Train T5 or T6 troops in your lower-level barracks. Fill your Drill Grounds with these "Baby Troops."
3.  **Promote High (Friday - VS Duel):** On Friday, use your higher-level barracks to promote them step-by-step.

:::danger STRICT DOCTRINE
**NEVER use the "Max Promote" feature to skip tiers.**
Even if your barracks allows you to go from T5 straight to T8, **DO NOT DO IT.** You must click "Promote" to the very next level only. We do not leave free points on the table.

## 3. Building Priority Matrix

| Priority | Building | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CRITICAL** | **Headquarters (HQ)** | The ceiling. Everything stops here. |
| **CRITICAL** | **Tech Center** | Keep this maxed to your HQ level always. |
| **CRITICAL** | **Tank/Air/Missile Centers** | **The most important military buildings.** These give you nice stat sticks and let you take more troops with your squads! Think of it as "HQ Lite" |
| **HIGH** | **Alliance Center** | Increases the number of "Help" clicks you receive. Higher level = More free time. |
| **HIGH** | **Smelters** | Produces **Ore** for upgrading gear. Gear is permanent stats. Keep these running 24/7. |
| **MEDIUM** | **Component Factory** | Produces **Screws** for crafting gear. A solid investment for the long game. |
| **MEDIUM** | **Drill Grounds** | Increases **Troop Capacity**. Essential for holding the army you are building. |
| **MEDIUM** | **Academy** | Generates Hero XP. A slow but steady trickle of free experience. |
| **MEDIUM** | **Gear Factory** | This is only here because you need to get it to level 20 to upgrade lvl 40 equipment. After that stop, it does literally nothing. |
| **LOW** | **Marching Grounds** | Increases **March Speed**. Nice for reaching targets faster, but doesn't help you win the fight. |
| **LOW** | **Hospitals** | Upgrade only as needed for HQ requirements. If your hospitals are full, you are fighting wrong. |
| **LOW** | **Alert Tower** | When you can upgrade it, it's super cheap. Might as well, gives you some decent buffs.|
| **LOW** | **Recon Planes** | Same deal as the alert tower. |
|**NEGATIVE** | **Builder Hut** | One minute off a 15 day build, for how many millions of resources? EW! |
|**NEGATIVE** | **Tavern** | Again, how many millions of resources for one hour off a single hero recruit ticket? Double Yuck. |
| **NEGATIVE** | **Drone Component Factory** | This will save you exactly two minutes off a single level 1 drone component. Basically nothing. |

## 4. The Economy (Safe vs. Unsafe)

### The Level 20 Soft Cap
For **Iron, Food, and Coin** production tiles:
* **The Rule:** Upgrade them to **Level 20** and stop.
* **The Logic:** Beyond Level 20, the cost to upgrade becomes so high that it takes *months* (sometimes >6 months) just to earn back the resources you spent on the upgrade.
* **Exception:** If you plan to play for 2+ years, you can upgrade them, but do not prioritize them over military buildings.

### Safe vs. Unsafe Assets
* **Top Bar Resources (Unsafe):** This is what you see at the top of your screen. If you are attacked, this can be stolen.
* **Inventory Chests (Safe):** Resources inside items in your backpack cannot be plundered.

:::danger The Cardinal Sin
**NEVER** open resource chests until the exact second you need to spend them.
* **Bad:** Opening 50M Food "just to have it." You are now a loot pinata.
* **Good:** Clicking "Upgrade" -> Game says "Insufficient Resources" -> Click "Use Items" -> Upgrade starts immediately.
