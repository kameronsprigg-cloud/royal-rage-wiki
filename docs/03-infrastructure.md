# Infrastructure & Logistics

> **Principle:** This isn't just a war game; it's a logistics simulator. If your base is inefficient, your army is irrelevant. We build smart, not hard. 

## 1. HQ Architecture (Dependencies)

    width: '300px',
    marginLeft: '20px',
    marginBottom: '10px'
  }}
/>

Unlike other games where you can rush the Town Hall, Last War enforces a strict dependency chain.

### The Tech Center Lock
* **The Rule:** Your Tech Center must *always* match your HQ level before you can proceed to the next HQ. 
* **Example:** To start HQ 26, you strictly require a Level 25 Tech Center.
* **Implication:** You can never "skip" tech infrastructure. It is the spine of your base.

### The Rotating Secondary
The game will rotate the second requirement for your HQ upgrade. This is usually one of the following:
* Wall 
* Tank / Aircraft / Missile Center 
* Hospital 
* Barracks
* Drill Grounds 

:::tip Doctrine
**Always check your HQ upgrade requirements immediately after finishing an HQ level.**
Know exactly which secondary building to rush next. Do not let a low-level wall bottleneck your growth.

## 2. The "Training Waterfall" (Barracks)

This is the single most important economy tactic in the game. Most players train T8 troops directly. This is mathematically lazy and forfeits millions of points. 

### The Concept
* **Time Cost:** It takes the exact same amount of time to promote a T5 to T6 as it does to promote a T7 to T8.
* **Point Gain:** If you train a T8 directly, you get points once. If you promote T5 to T6 to T7 to T8, you get points **three separate times** for the same soldier. 

### The Barracks Setup
To execute this, you need a specific spread of Barracks levels to handle the different "steps" of the waterfall. 

**The Royal Spread:**
1.  **Barracks 1:** Level 27 (High Tier Output)
2.  **Barracks 2:** Level 24
3.  **Barracks 3:** Level 20
4.  **Barracks 4:** Level 17 (Baby Troop Training)

### The Protocol
* **Train Low (Mon-Thurs):** Train T5 troops in all of your barracks. Fill your Drill Grounds with these "Baby Troops." 
* **Promote High (Friday - VS Duel):** On Friday, use your higher-level barracks to promote them step-by-step.

:::danger STRICT DOCTRINE
**NEVER promote beyong the next step**
Even if your barracks allows you to go from T5 straight to T8, **DO NOT DO IT.** You must be strategic about this.
:::

### Example: Drill grounds at start of Total Mobilization Day

T5: 20,000 

T9: 3,000

Max barracks level = 27

:::danger If all barracks are "open for business" when you promote, it will automatically promote your T5's to T9.
:::

Barracks 27, 24, 20, 17 have all finished training T5 troops. You have **NOT** yet sent those troops to the drill ground. 

**Step 1**: Send troops from Barracks 20 to drill ground. This barracks is now open for business. 

**Step 2**: Tap on the drill ground. Select your T5s to promote. They will start promoting in your level 20 barracks to T6. 

**Step 3**: Speed it up to get the ball moving. 

**Step 4**: Send the T6s to the drill ground. 

**Step 5**: Send troops from Barracks 24 to drill ground. 

**Step 6**: Tap on the drill ground, promote your T6's. **THEN** select T5's to promote.They will promote to T7, and T6 respectively. 

**Step 7**: Speed both of them up again.

**Step 8**: Repeat until you have troops of every available tier training.

## 3. Survivors (The Staff)

Survivors are the staff you assign to buildings. They come in rarities (UR > SSR > SR > R > Common).

* **Acquisition:** Pure RNG (Tavern, Doom Walker). You get what you get.
* **Usage:** Put them in buildings to boost passive stats (e.g., Construction Speed, Production). 

### The Barracks Survivor Strategy
There is only one place where survivor strategy matters: **The Barracks.**

* **Problem:** High-level barracks train more troops than low-level ones, taking longer. This desyncs your timers.
* **Solution:** Place your strongest Survivors (UR/SSR) in your **lowest level Barracks**.
* **Result:** The survivors boost the training capacity of the weak barracks, bringing its timer closer to the strong barracks. This allows you to pop a single **Secretary of Defense** puff and have it cover all 4 barracks finishing at roughly the same time.

## 4. Building Priority Matrix

We prioritize function over vanity. Do not waste speed-ups on D-Tier buildings. 

| Priority | Building | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CRITICAL** | **Headquarters (HQ)** | The ceiling. Everything stops here. Priority #1 at all times. |
| **CRITICAL** | **Tech Center** | Mandatory. Required for every single HQ level. Keep this maxed. |
| **CRITICAL** | **Tank/Air/Missile Centers** | Stat Sticks. These provide passive HP, Attack, Def, and March Capacity to all heroes of that type. |
| **HIGH** | **Alliance Center** | Increases the number of "Help" clicks you receive. Higher level = More free time. |
| **HIGH** | **Smelters** | Produces Ore for upgrading gear. Gear is permanent stats. Keep these running 24/7.|
| **MEDIUM** | **Drill Grounds** | Increases Troop Capacity. Essential for holding the army you are building. |
| **MEDIUM** | **Component Factory** | Produces Screws for crafting gear. A solid investment for the long game. |
| **MEDIUM** | **Academy** | Generates Hero XP. A slow but steady trickle of free experience.  |
| **LOW** | **Hospitals** | Meh. Keep one maxed for HQ requirements. Leave the others low (Level 17ish). |
| **LOW** | **Gear Factory** | Get it to Level 20 to unlock Level 40 equipment crafting. After that, it is useless. |
| **LOW** | **Alert Tower** | Cheap upgrades. Gives decent buffs. Do it when you have spare time. |
| **NEGATIVE** | **Builder Hut** | One minute off a 15-day build? Useless. |
| **NEGATIVE** | **Tavern** | Millions of resources for 1 hour off a free ticket timer? Scam. |
| **NEGATIVE** | **Drone Component Factory** | Saves seconds. Waste of resources. Spending 10M resources for a 2-minute reduction is a scam. |

## 5. The Economy (The Trap)

### The Level 20 Hard Stop
For Iron, Food, and Coin production tiles (Mines/Farms):

* **The Rule:** Upgrade them to Level 20 and **STOP**. 
* **The Math:** Beyond Level 20, the cost to upgrade becomes astronomical. It takes months to earn back the resources you spent on the upgrade itself. This is because each upgrade only gives a flat **720** bonus. This gets multiplied by research and survivors, but not enough to justify millions of cost.

### The Opportunity Cost
Every million food you spend upgrading a Level 25 Farm is a million food you didn't spend on research or building something more useful.

* **Result:** You are permanently weaker today for a payoff that might arrive in 2027.
* **Doctrine:** Be stronger next year? No. We are lethal today. Stop at 20.

## 4. Decorations (Stat Sticks)
If you look good, you fight good. Decorations are not just vanity; they are percentage-based stat multipliers.

### The Upgrade Path
Prioritize upgrading UR decorations to **Level 3** to unlock secondary effects. 

**Priority Order:**
1.  **% Damage Reduction** (S-Tier)
2.  **% Skill / Crit Damage** (A-Tier)
3.  **% Attack / Defense / HP** (B-Tier) 

:::danger Resource Discipline
**Never** use decoration components on non-UR decorations. You get the lower-tier ones for free. Save your components for the gear that matters.
