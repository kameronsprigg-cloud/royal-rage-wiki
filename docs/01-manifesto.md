# The Royal Rage Doctrine

> **Motto:** "Where drama and childish behavior go to die."

## Identity
We are the adults in the room. We play with class, discipline, and lethal efficiency. We do not engage in world chat toxicity. We let our results speak.

## The "Elite" Standard
We prioritize **organization over raw spending**. We beat opponents with 30% more power because we work harder and smarter.

## Real Life First
We understand life happens, but we require communication.
* **Silence is unacceptable.**
* **Absence is forgiven if communicated.**

### Core Operating Principles

| Principle | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lethal Efficiency** | We don't just click buttons. We use specific buffs (Puffs) and timing to maximize every action. |
| **The "Adult" Room** | We do not argue in World Chat. If someone attacks us, we burn them quietly. |
| **Data Driven** | We use the "Royal Rage" math. We know that 1.3 Morale = 1.3x Damage. We make the numbers work for us. |
