# Daily Routine: Logistics & Spec Ops

## 1. The Radar

Your Radar is your primary source of stamina dumps and "Digs."

* **Mechanic:** As you complete tasks, your Radar levels up. Higher level = More tasks stored, faster recovery.

### The Schedule (VS Synchronization)
Do not clear your Radar mindlessly.

* **Radar Days:** Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
* **The Protocol:** On non-Radar days (Tue/Thu/Sun), **save your tasks**. On Radar days, clear them all to score VS points.
* **Saturday Exception:** You can clear tasks on Saturday to prevent overflow/capping out.

### Task Types

| Type | Stamina | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard** | 10 | Rescue missions or resource collections. Standard filler. |
| **Doom Elite** | 20 | High value. Do these. |
| **Doom Walker** | 20 | The game often suggests a Walker that is too hard. **Check the power level before marching.** |
| **The Dig** | 0 | **CRITICAL PRIORITY.** See protocol below. |

### "The Dig" Protocol
Digs provide massive Alliance-wide rewards (Diamonds, Speed-ups, Ore).

* **Share Immediately:** When you find a Dig, share it to Alliance Chat.
* **Help:** Click "Help" on others' digs. It reduces the timer from 2 hours down to ~45 seconds with enough participants.
* **The Loot Scramble:** Once a dig finishes, there are only 10 Loot Spots. Speed matters. First come, first served.

## 2. Secret Tasks (The Spec Ops)

These are passive missions that require heroes but do not lock them. Your heroes can go on a Secret Task and still fight in a war simultaneously.

### The Tier List

| Tier | Quality | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UR** | Orange | **4-Hour Timer.** Best rewards. Priority target. |
| **SSR** | Purple | Good enough. If it's not a VS day, take these to save rerolls. |
| **SR** | Blue | Acceptable only if you are low on rerolls. |
| **UR Star** | Special | A special task that cannot be rerolled. It gives rewards one level higher than your HQ normally allows. |

### The "4-Hour" Trap

:::danger TACTICAL RISK
**UR tasks take 4 hours. Most players start them immediately after server reset (00:00).**

* **The Risk:** At 04:00, the entire server's UR tasks finish at the same time. Plunderers know this.
* **The Strategy:** Delay starting your UR tasks by ~1 hour. This offsets your timer from the "feeding frenzy," reducing the chance of being raided. Better yet, wait 6+ hours before starting any secret tasks. Most people have used all their plunders by this point.
:::

### Plundering Protocol
* **Target:** Enemy Servers ONLY. (See Operating Protocols).
* **Priority:** Look for UR Tasks containing **Skill XP** or **Equipment Ore**.
* **Defense:** You can "Assist" allies 5 times a day. This protects them from further plundering, and gives you a small reward.

## 3. Trucks (The Convoys)

You get 4 trucks per day.

### Deployment Strategy
* **One at a Time:** Never send all 4 trucks at once.
* **Defense:** Assign your #1 Strongest Squad to defend the truck.
* **Selection:** Reroll for UR (Orange) trucks, or SSR trucks with Hero Shards. Do not settle for trash.

### Raiding Strategy
* **Target:** Enemy Servers ONLY.

**The Loot List:**
1.  **UR Shards:** The holy grail.
2.  **Secret Task Orders:** Free rerolls.
3.  **Trade Contracts:** Essential for the Train.
4.  **Alliance Contribution:** Large piles (2.5k).
5.  **Capitol War Prep:** Raiding UR trucks during prep week gives our server a tactical advantage (Attacker vs Defender status).

## 4. The Train (Alliance Logistics)

The Train is a cooperative lottery.

* **Structure:** 1 Conductor (R4/R5), 4 Carriages, 20 Passengers.

### The Carriages
1.  Drone Gears
2.  Equipment Ore
3.  Skill Points / Resources
4.  Decoration Components

### The Mechanics
* **Lottery:** Each carriage holds 5 people. If 12 people apply for the "Ore" carriage, the game randomly selects 5. The rest get nothing.
* **Reroll:** The Conductor uses 5 Trade Contracts to re-roll the train. After 5 rolls, it is guaranteed Gold.
* **Plundering:** You can plunder other alliances' trains, but it uses one of your truck plunder chances.
* **Donating:** By donating trade contracts, you make it so that the conductor has enough to roll for a good train. It's good for you, and it's common courtesy. Don't be a free-loader - donate at least one, preferably 3.

:::info Verdict on Plundering the Train
**Usually not worth it.** Targeted truck raiding yields better specific loot than spending a plunder chance on a random train carriage.
