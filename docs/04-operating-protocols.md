title: Operating Protocols (Puffs & Conduct)

# Operating Protocols

> **Principle:** Discipline beats motivation. Motivation is why you start; discipline is why you win. We do not click buttons randomly. We execute protocols.

## 1. The Ministry (Puffs)

The Secretary Titles (Puffs) are free stat multipliers. Ignoring them is negligent.

### The Mechanics

* **How to Access:** Tap Profile (Top Left) $\rightarrow$ Tap Server Number (e.g., #1981) $\rightarrow$ "Capitol" $\rightarrow$ Select Role.
* **The Golden Rule:** Puffs apply at the **START** of a task.
    * If you start a 10-day research and *then* get the buff, it does nothing.
    * You must get the buff **BEFORE** you click the button.



### Standard Operating Puffs

| Role | Priority | When to Use | The "Royal Rage" Math |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Secretary of Development** | **Critical** | Building | **+50% Construction Speed.** Mandatory for any build over 4 hours. |
| **Secretary of Science** | **Critical** | Research | **+50% Research Speed.** Never start a major tech research without this. |
| **Secretary of Defense** | **High** | Troop Training | **+25% Capacity / +25% Speed.** <br/> *Note:* The speed and capacity cancel out time-wise. You train 25% more troops in the same amount of time. Use this for overnight queues. |
| **Secretary of Interior** | **High** | Collecting | **+100% Production.** Used for the "Double Dip" (see below). |
| **Secretary of Strategy** | **Niche** | Healing | Use only during **Desert Storm**. The healing speed boost is critical there. Otherwise, ignore. |

:::info The "Victor's Spoils" (Wartime Buffs)
If our server wins the Capitol War, the buffs get supercharged for the week:

* **Dev & Sci:** Boost increases to **60%**.
* **Interior:** Boost increases to **150%**.
* **New Role - Administrative Commander:** Gives the buffs of both Dev and Sci simultaneously.
* **New Role - Military Commander:** +5% March Speed, +5% PVP Death Rate. (Purely for war).

## 2. The "Interior Double Dip"

This is the single easiest way to double your passive income.

**The Protocol:**

1.  **Wait:** Do not collect your resource tiles (Mines, Farms) when you wake up. Let them sit full.
2.  **Puff:** Request **Secretary of Interior**.
3.  **Collect:** Once the title is active **THEN** tap to collect all resources.



:::tip The Result
You instantly get **200%** (or **250%** if we won the war) of the resources your base produced while you were sleeping. It is literally free money.

## 3. The Code of Conduct (ROEs)

### Identity
**"We are the adults in the room."**
We do not engage in toxicity. We play with class. If someone drops a Golden Egg in World Chat, say "Thank you." Keep chat PG-ish.

### Raiding Protocol (Trucks & Tasks)
* **The Target:** We raid **Enemy Servers only**.
* **The Ban:** We **NEVER** raid our own server.
    * We do not cannibalize our allies.
    * We strictly do not raid our own Alliance members.
* **The Process:** Spend 5 minutes scanning an enemy server. Find the loot. Take it. Share leftovers in Alliance Chat.

### Retaliation
* **Self-Defense:** If you are hit, you may hit back (1-for-1).
* **Escalation:** If the aggressor is *not* from a Top 10 alliance, burn them. If they *are*, let Leadership handle the diplomacy.

### Resource Tiles (Mining)
* **Standard:** Do not hit tiles occupied by others.
* **Capitol War Exception:** "The Mud" (Contaminated Land).
    * During Capitol War, attacking tiles in the central "Mud" area is encouraged for Honor Points. No permission needed.
