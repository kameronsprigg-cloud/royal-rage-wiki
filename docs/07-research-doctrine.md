# Research Doctrine

> **Philosophy:** "Valor Badges are the currency of the midgame. Spend them like a miser."

## 1. The Absolute Priority: The "9-Box" Rush

Before you look at combat stats, you must secure your income. The primary source of Valor Badges in this game is the VS Duel Chests.

### Phase 1: Unlock the Boxes
Your #1 goal on a new account is to unlock the "Alliance Duel" tech tree.

* **Target:** Research deep enough to unlock the **9th chest reward**.
* **Why:** 9 Chests = Maximum Valor Badges daily.
* **The Loop:** You need Valor Badges to research "Special Forces." You get Valor Badges from VS Boxes. Therefore, you must max your VS income first.

### Phase 2: The Hard Stop
Once you have unlocked the 9th box... **STOP.**

* Do not max out the VS tree.
* **Switch immediately to Special Forces.**
* *Exception:* Only return to this tree later in the game when Special Forces research becomes too expensive (costing 500m + gold per click) and you need a cheaper place to dump speedups and badges for points on Wednesday.

## 2. Time is Money

* **The Trap:** If you waste time on other technologies, you will hit a wall in the mid-game where you have months worth of research and billions of resources between you and T10 troops.
* **The Rule:** Every single Wednesday, aim to complete at least 2 or 3 special forces research items to get points for VS and keep pace with unlocking T10s.

## 3. The Tech Priority Tree (Post-9 Box)

Once your income is secured (Phase 1), use this matrix to decide where to spend your badges.

| Tier | Category | Rationale & Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S-Tier** | **The Holy Grail** | **Special Forces, Units, Heroes.** <br/> These are the only trees that matter for lethal combat. <br/> • **Special Forces:** The only path to T10 Troops. Save every badge for this. <br/> • **Units:** Essential combat stats. <br/> • **Heroes:** "Competent Command" improves hero stats. |
| **A-Tier** | **Infrastructure** | **Development.** <br/> • **Goal:** Research as needed to unlock extra Barracks and Hospitals. <br/> • **Bonus:** Research speed buffs are critical here. <br/> • **Verdict:** Unlock the buildings, then pivot back to S-Tier. |
| **B-Tier** | **Squads (Depth)** | **Squad 1:** Max this out first for your main march. <br/> **Squad 2 & 3:** Only touch these when you actually have a competent backup lineup (full UR heroes with gear). <br/> *The Truth:* Buffing a squad of Level 100 SR heroes is a waste. |
| **C-Tier** | **Economy** | **Meh.** <br/> The cost to research is a fortune, and the payback period is essentially "never." Only viable if you plan to play for 2+ years. <br/> Get this tree to around 65%, then focus elsewhere. |
| **F-Tier** | **The Traps** | **Last priority.** <br/> • **Trucks:** The rewards are not worth the Badges. 

:::danger STRICT ORDER
**Prioritize "Special Forces" above all else.**

If you have the resources and it's tech day in VS - you're spending valor badges on Special Forces node.
