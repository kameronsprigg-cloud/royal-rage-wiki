# Combat Doctrine: Squads & Heroes

> **Principle:** Our heroes are monsters. We don't send rookies into battle with poor tactics.

## 1. Squad Positioning
Positioning doesn't increase your raw power number, but it **drastically** improves performance. 

| Position | Role | Examples | Doctrine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Front Row** | **The Meat Shields** | Murphy, Williams, Carlie | Big, beefy, bulky boys. If they have a shield icon, they go here. |
| **Back Middle** | **The Ace** | Kim, Tesla, Schulyer| Your biggest hitter. **KEEP THEM ALIVE.** They stay protected in the center. |
| **Back Sides** | **Support / DPS** | Marshall, Morrison, Mason | Supports and up-and-coming damage dealers. |

:::tip The Level 20 Checkpoint
Level up gear one item at a time to **Level 20**. You get huge side effects (mastery bonuses) at this specific level. Check out "The Forge" for more info.

## 2. Skill Levelling Order
Skills get expensive fast. Do not spread resources evenly; prioritize your **Ace** first. 

1.  **Active Skill (Slot 2):** Highest priority.
2.  **Passive Skill (Slot 3):** Second priority.
3. **Basic Attack (Slot 1):** Lowest priority.

## 3. Team Synergy (The Vibe Check)
Heroes perform better with their friends. Mixing types haphazardly drags the team down. 

| Composition | Bonus Stats | Rating |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5 of a Kind** | **+20% HP/ATK/DEF** | **Elite** (Goal) |
| **4 of a Kind** | +15% (to the 4) | Great |
| **3 + 2 Split** | +10% (to all) | Decent |
| **3 Split** | +5% | Poor |
| **2 + 2 + 1** | +0% | **F-Tier** (Do not do this) |

## 4. Counter Tactics

There's an important mechanic in this game. It's called rock-paper-scissors. 

Heroes of one class counter another class. In the early game, this is a minor consideration, as all of your resources should be focused on one squad. 

As you progress further, it becomes advantageous to use this mechanic to your advantage. 

| Class | Strong Against | Weak Against |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tank** | **Missile** | **Aircraft**|
| **Aircraft** | **Tank** | **Missile** |
| **Missile** | **Aircraft** | **Tank** |

The impact of these class match-ups is huge. 

:::danger  Win the rock-paper-scissors game
If your squad counters the opponent squad, then they receive **20% less damage**.

This is enough to swing a battle in your favor when you're otherwise much weaker than the opponent.
