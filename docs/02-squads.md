# Combat Doctrine: Squads & Heroes

> **Principle:** An amateur with incredible equipment is pretty good. A MASTER with state-of-the-art equipment is Leonardo DaVinci painting the Mona Lisa. Except it's zombies. And your paint is blood. 

## 1. Squad Positioning
Positioning doesn't increase your raw power number, but it **drastically** improves performance. 

| Position | Role | Examples | Doctrine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Front Row** | **The Meat Shields** | Murphy, Williams, Carlie | Big, beefy, bulky boys. If they have a shield icon, they go here. |
| **Back Middle** | **The Ace** | Kim, Tesla, Stettman | Your biggest hitter. **KEEP THEM ALIVE.** They stay protected in the center. |
| **Back Sides** | **Support / DPS** | Marshall, DVA, Mason | Supports and up-and-coming damage dealers. |

## 2. Equipment Priorities (The "Quad G")
**Rule:** Good Gear Gets Goodies. 
Dismantle everything below Gold. Level up your screw production.

### Upgrade Priority Table

| Role | Slot 1 | Slot 2 | Slot 3 | Slot 4 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ACES** (Damage) | **1. Railgun** | **2. Data Chip** | 3. Radar | 4. Armor |
| **TANKS** (Defense) | 4. Railgun | 3. Data Chip | **1. Radar** | **2. Armor** |

:::tip The Level 20 Checkpoint
Level up gear one item at a time to **Level 20**. You get huge side effects (mastery bonuses) at this specific level.

## 3. Skill Levelling Order
Skills get expensive fast. Do not spread resources evenly; prioritize your **Ace** first. 

1.  **Active Skill (Slot 2):** Highest priority.
2.  **Passive Skill (Slot 3):** Second priority.
3. **Basic Attack (Slot 1):** Lowest priority.

## 4. Team Synergy (The Vibe Check)
Heroes perform better with their friends. Mixing types haphazardly drags the team down. 

| Composition | Bonus Stats | Rating |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5 of a Kind** | **+20% HP/ATK/DEF** | **Elite** (Goal) |
| **4 of a Kind** | +15% (to the 4) | Great |
| **3 + 2 Split** | +10% (to all) | Decent |
| **3 Split** | +5% | Poor |
| **2 + 2 + 1** | +0% | **F-Tier** (Do not do this) |

## 5. Decorations (Stat Sticks)
If you look good, you fight good. Decorations are not just vanity; they are percentage-based stat multipliers.

### The Upgrade Path
Prioritize upgrading UR decorations to **Level 3** to unlock secondary effects. 

**Priority Order:**
1.  **% Damage Reduction** (S-Tier)
2.  **% Skill / Crit Damage** (A-Tier)
3.  **% Attack / Defense / HP** (B-Tier) 

:::danger Resource Discipline
**Never** use decoration components on non-UR decorations. You get the lower-tier ones for free. Save your components for the gear that matters.
