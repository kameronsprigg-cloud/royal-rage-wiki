# Equipment Strategy: The Forge

> **Philosophy:** "A Level 150 hero in plastic armor is just a target. We forge Gold, or we forge nothing."

## 1. The Golden Rule

**For ALL heroes, you want nothing but Gold (Legendary) gear.**

* **The Trap:** Do not invest Ore (Blue Triangles) into Purple or Blue gear.
* **The Transition:** Hang on to your purple gear until you craft a Gold replacement, but **do not upgrade it**.
* **Disposal:** Dismantle old gear immediately upon replacement to recover resources.

---

## 2. Defense Doctrine (Tanks)

Ask yourself: *Who are the primary damage dealers in the game right now?*
**Kimberly, Schuyler, DVA, Tesla, Stettman.**

* **The Commonality:** They all deal **ENERGY DAMAGE**.
* **The Implication:** Physical Defense (Armor) is statistically less valuable than Energy Defense (Radar) in the current meta.

### The Defensive Hierarchy
| Priority | Item | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. CRITICAL** | **Radar** | **Energy Defense.** Counters the meta (Kim/Tesla). This is your tank's lifeline. |
| **2. HIGH** | **Armor** | **Physical Defense.** Good generally, but secondary to Radar. |
| **3. MEDIUM** | **Data Chip** | **Damage Reduction / HP.** Provides flat damage reduction, but lacks the raw defense stats needed to mitigate nuke damage. |

## 3. Attack Doctrine (DPS)

Everybody likes a big gun.

| Priority | Item | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. CRITICAL** | **Railgun** | **Attack.** Pure damage output. |
| **2. HIGH** | **Data Chip** | **HP & Crit/Attack.** Keeps your attacker alive long enough to shoot, and boosts secondary offensive stats. |

## 4. The "Rule of 10" (Leveling Strategy)

Every 10 levels, equipment gains a **Mastery Bonus** (extra stats/effects). These spikes are massive at Level 20 and Level 40.

:::danger STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE
**Do not spread your resources evenly.**
You will *always* prefer leveling a single piece of equipment to the next multiple of ten rather than spreading Ore across four items.
:::

* **Example:** If you have a Railgun at Level 21, your Ore goes into **NOTHING** other than that Railgun until it hits Level 30.
* **The Goal:** We chase the "Breakpoints" (10, 20, 30, 40). We do not stop at 24.

## 5. The Upgrade Roadmap (Priority List)

Level 20 is the first major power spike. Follow this strict order of operations to maximize combat efficiency.

### Phase 1: The Essentials (Level 0 to 20)

1.  **Main DPS (Ace):** Railgun **Level 20**. (Maximum Kill Pressure).
2.  **Main Tank:** Radar **Level 20**. (Survive the Energy Burst).
3.  **Main Tank:** Armor **Level 20**.
4.  **Main DPS (Ace):** Data Chip **Level 20**.
5.  **Main DPS (Ace):** Radar & Armor **Level 20**. (Keep the carry alive).
6.  **Support / Secondary DPS:** Fill in their gear to Level 20.

### Phase 2: The Mythic Grind (Level 20 $\rightarrow$ 40)

Once your main squad has full Level 20 gear, you begin the long grind to Level 40. Upgrading beyond 40 requires **Blueprints** (from the Honor Shop) and massive amounts of Ore, gold, and ceramic.

:::tip Blueprint Strategy
**You HAVE been buying Blueprints from the Honor Shop, right?**
If not, start today. Buy nothing else until you are stocked.
:::

**The Level 40 Priority:**

1.  **Main DPS:** Railgun **Level 40**.
    * *No ifs, ands, or buts.* A Level 40 Railgun melts enemy squads.
2.  **Main Tank:** Radar **Level 40**.
3.  **Main DPS:** Data Chip **Level 40**.

**The Focus Rule:**
When pushing for Level 40, **prioritize one item at a time.**
* Better to have **one item with 3 Stars** than four items with 1 Star.
* Focus fire your resources. Complete the item. Move to the next.
